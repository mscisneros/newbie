## Overview
This example serves as my personal sandbox and was developed with v4.0.0 in an effort to build an actual functional prototype using the latest enhancements. In addition, I've been experimenting with Material Design to really focus on the visual design and the importance of whitespace, shadows, typography, colors and layout grids.

In addition, it further demonstrates how a company's website can be leveraged as it's primary lead generation tool with a focus on user experience and inbound digital marketing methodologies.
